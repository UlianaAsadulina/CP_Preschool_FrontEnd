                        Everyone knows the importance of schedules, even if the schedule is in an infant classroom.
                        When your little one is in our care, you will discover that your infant's schedule at school is tailored to your schedule at home.
                        Our experienced staff wants everything to be consistent with your routine, so tell us when to lay your baby down for a nap,
                        your child's feeding schedule, and how often you would like his or her diaper changed and we will be happy to accommodate everything.
                        Along with following your exact routine, our staff will also document everything that happened during your child's day so that you can
                        know exactly how it went. Even though you weren't with your child during their day in our care, you will know all the details of his or
                        her day with your personalized daily report.
                        The only part of your baby's day we won't accommodate on is snuggling because we provide those all day long!

                    <h3>Toddlers (18m-3yrs)</h3>
                    <p>

                        The best part about being a toddler is learning.
                        The experienced staff at The Prescool allows your toddler to explore the different aspects of life during active play in a safe environment.
                        The children in our toddler classroom love socializing during circle time, listening to stories, and singing songs with their friends
                        during their day at The Preschool.
                        Your children begin very basic self-help skills while in our care to help them grow into a responsible preschooler.
                        They are expected to put their coats and backpacks into their personal cubbies as well as share with others and help clean up toys after playtime.
                        The toddler room at The Preschool offers the perfect balance between quiet and interactive activities for your toddler who is always on the go.

                    <p>

                        School-age children will experience a very open-ended curriculum.
                        We will also provide them with age appropriate activities to engage in before and after school.

                        The children will assist the teachers in planning activities for when they are not in school, such as summer and holiday breaks.
                        When the children are in school we provide them with materials and teacher support to assist them with their homework.

                    <p>


                        The Preschool provides a Summer Camp Program for elementary school children.
                        The camp consists of at least one field trip per week, along with fun and exciting adventures here at the center.
                        The children will not only be exploring their community by going on field trips, but they will be participating in enrichment activities in reading, math and science.
                        We will continue to further their education by engaging them in daily activities to keep their minds stimulated while still enjoying a fun, relaxing summer.
